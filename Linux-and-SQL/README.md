# 🌐 Course 4 Overview – Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL
Welcome to Course 4 of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate: Tools of the Trade – Linux and SQL

This course explores how cybersecurity professionals harness the power of two essential tools: the Linux operating system and Structured Query Language (SQL). These technologies help analysts navigate systems, automate tasks, query databases, and investigate security events. Through guided labs, real-world scenarios, and shell-based exercises, I’ll master hands-on techniques that strengthen security workflows in any SOC environment.

# 🧠 What You'll Learn
🧭 Understand how operating systems work — including user interfaces, kernel functions, and virtualization 🐧 Navigate Linux environments, distributions, and package managers using shell commands 💻 Execute Bash commands to manage files, users, and system permissions 🗃️ Write and optimize SQL queries to analyze data and support threat detection

# 📂 Module Breakdown
Operating Systems – Explore how OSs function and support cybersecurity tasks

Linux OS – Learn about distributions, shell environments, and Linux architecture

Bash Commands – Perform administrative tasks, audits, and permission management in CLI

SQL Databases – Query log data and correlate information to support investigations

# 🧭 Module 1: Introduction to Operating Systems

## 📌 Overview

This module explores the role of operating systems (OS) in computing environments. You'll learn how OSs interact with hardware and software, and how users engage with them through graphical and command-line interfaces.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **OS Functions**: Resource allocation, process management, file systems
- **Types of OS**: Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile OSs
- **User Interfaces**:
  - **GUI**: Visual interaction (e.g., Windows Explorer)
  - **CLI**: Text-based commands (e.g., Bash shell)

---

## 🔍 Security Relevance

- OS-level access control and permissions
- Virtualization and sandboxing
- CLI as a tool for forensic analysis and automation

---

## 🧪 Activities

- Compare GUI vs CLI workflows
- Identify OS components and their functions
- Explore virtualization technologies

---

## 🧠 Portfolio Ideas

- Create a visual comparison of OS types and interfaces
- Document a CLI vs GUI task walkthrough
- Build a glossary of OS security terms

# 🐧 Module 2: The Linux Operating System

## 📌 Overview

This module introduces Linux — a powerful, open-source OS widely used in cybersecurity. You'll explore its architecture, distributions, and how users interact with it via the shell.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Linux Architecture**: Kernel, shell, file system
- **Distributions**: Ubuntu, Kali Linux, CentOS
- **Package Managers**: `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`
- **Shell Types**: Bash, Zsh, Fish

---

## 🔐 Security Relevance

- Linux is foundational in penetration testing and server hardening
- Kali Linux is a specialized distro for ethical hacking
- Shell access is critical for remote administration and scripting

---

## 🧪 Activities

- Install software using a package manager
- Explore input/output in the shell
- Compare Linux distributions and their use cases

---

## 🧠 Portfolio Ideas

- Create a Linux distro comparison chart
- Document a shell-based software installation
- Build a Linux architecture diagram

---

# 💻 Module 3: Linux Commands in the Bash Shell

## 📌 Overview

This module teaches you how to use Bash — the most common Linux shell — to navigate, manage, and secure a system. You'll learn commands for file manipulation, user management, and permission control.

---

## 🧠 Key Commands

- **Navigation**: `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`
- **File Management**: `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`
- **Search & Filter**: `grep`, `find`, `cat`, `less`
- **Permissions**: `chmod`, `chown`, `sudo`
- **User Management**: `adduser`, `deluser`, `passwd`

---

## 🔐 Security Relevance

- Bash is used for log analysis, automation, and system hardening
- Permission commands help enforce least privilege
- User authentication and authorization are managed via CLI

---

## 🧪 Activities

- Navigate and manipulate the file system
- Manage file permissions and ownership
- Add and delete users securely
- Use `man` pages to self-learn new commands

---

## 🧠 Portfolio Ideas

- Build a Bash cheat sheet
- Document a permission audit using CLI
- Create a user management workflow diagram

---

# 🗃️ Module 4: Databases and SQL

## 📌 Overview

This module introduces relational databases and SQL (Structured Query Language). You'll learn how to query, filter, and join data — essential skills for cybersecurity analysts working with logs and threat intel.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Relational Databases**: Tables, rows, columns, keys
- **SQL Basics**: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- **Filtering**: `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`
- **Joins**: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- **Aggregation**: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `GROUP BY`

---

## 🔐 Security Relevance

- SQL is used to query logs, alerts, and user activity
- Understanding joins helps correlate data across systems
- SQL injection is a common attack vector — knowing SQL helps defend against it

---

## 🧪 Activities

- Query a database for specific records
- Filter results using conditions
- Join multiple tables to analyze relationships

---

## 🧠 Portfolio Ideas
