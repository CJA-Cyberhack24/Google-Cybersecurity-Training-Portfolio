A structured lifecycle approach to identify, manage, and monitor system risk.

### 🔄 7-Step RMF Lifecycle


| Step         | Description                                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prepare**   | Establish context, stakeholders, and security strategies   |
| **Categorize**| Determine impact levels based on system types              |
| **Select**    | Choose appropriate controls from NIST SP 800-53 catalog    |
| **Implement** | Deploy controls and document implementation                |
| **Assess**    | Verify control effectiveness via testing and evaluation    |
| **Authorize** | Approve system operation based on assessed risk            |
