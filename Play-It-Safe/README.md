# 📌 Module 1 – Security Domains & Risk Management

This module introduces foundational concepts in cybersecurity: threat evaluation, risk management, and professional security standards.

---

## 🧭 CISSP Eight Security Domains

These domains represent the key knowledge areas for security professionals:

| Domain # | Security Domain                       | Description                                        |
|----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣       | Security & Risk Management             | Governance, policies, CIA triad, ethics            |
| 2️⃣       | Asset Security                         | Data classification, handling, ownership           |
| 3️⃣       | Security Architecture & Engineering   | Secure design principles, cryptography, hardware   |
| 4️⃣       | Communication & Network Security      | Network protocols, segmentation, secure comms      |
| 5️⃣       | Identity & Access Management (IAM)    | User auth, privileges, provisioning                 |
| 6️⃣       | Security Assessment & Testing         | Vulnerability scans, audits, pentesting            |
| 7️⃣       | Security Operations                    | Logging, monitoring, incident response             |
| 8️⃣       | Software Development Security          | Secure coding, SDLC, threat modeling               |

🧠 *Memory Tip:* Think of these domains as your cybersecurity map—each one tackles a critical piece of the security puzzle.

## ⚠️ Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

| Concept        | Definition                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Threat**     | Potential event that could harm assets or disrupt systems                   |
| **Risk**       | Likelihood + impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability                  |
| **Vulnerability** | Weakness in a system that could be exploited by threats                    |

📌 *Risk Formula:*  
> `Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact`

---

## 🛡️ NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

A structured lifecycle approach to identify, manage, and monitor system risk.

### 🔄 7-Step RMF Lifecycle


| Step         | Description                                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prepare**   | Establish context, stakeholders, and security strategies   |
| **Categorize**| Determine impact levels based on system types              |
| **Select**    | Choose appropriate controls from NIST SP 800-53 catalog    |
| **Implement** | Deploy controls and document implementation                |
| **Assess**    | Verify control effectiveness via testing and evaluation    |
| **Authorize** | Approve system operation based on assessed risk            |
| **Monitor**   | Continuously track system changes and control performance  |

🧠 *Why It Matters:* RMF ensures every system decision aligns with organizational risk tolerance and security goals.
