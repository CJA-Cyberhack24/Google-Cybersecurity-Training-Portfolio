<h2><p align="center">🔐 Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Course 2</h2>

## 🎯 Title: Play It Safe – Manage Security Risks

Part of the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-security-risks?specialization=google-cybersecurity)

This course explores how security analysts identify risks, apply frameworks, monitor threats, and respond to incidents across enterprise environments.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

- 📊 Identify business risks, threats, and vulnerabilities  
- 🛠️ Apply frameworks like NIST CSF, CIA triad, and OWASP  
- 🧭 Use SIEM dashboards and logs for analysis  
- 🚨 Execute incident response using playbooks

## 🧩 Modules Breakdown

📌 Module 1: Security Domains & Risk Management
🧭 CISSP Eight Security Domains
These domains form the backbone of cybersecurity knowledge. Each one represents a key area of expertise for security professionals.

Domain #	Name	Focus Area
1️⃣	Security & Risk Management	Governance, compliance, ethics, CIA triad
2️⃣	Asset Security	Data classification, ownership, retention
3️⃣	Security Architecture & Engineering	Secure design, cryptography, physical security
4️⃣	Communication & Network Security	Network protocols, secure architecture
5️⃣	Identity & Access Management (IAM)	Authentication, authorization, provisioning
6️⃣	Security Assessment & Testing	Audits, vulnerability scans, penetration tests
7️⃣	Security Operations	Logging, monitoring, incident response
8️⃣	Software Development Security	Secure coding, SDLC, threat modeling
🖼️ Visual Representation: You can explore a mindmap-style breakdown of these domains on Destination Certification or Edureka’s CISSP Guide.

⚠️ Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities
Concept	Definition
Threat	A potential cause of an unwanted incident (e.g., malware, insider attack)
Risk	The likelihood and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability
Vulnerability	A weakness in a system that can be exploited (e.g., outdated software)
🧠 Memory Tip:

Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact

🛡️ NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The NIST RMF is a structured approach to managing security and privacy risks across the system lifecycle.

🔄 6-Step RMF Process
[ Prepare ] → [ Categorize ] → [ Select ] → [ Implement ] → [ Assess ] → [ Authorize ] → [ Monitor ]
Step	Purpose
Prepare	Set organizational context and risk strategy
Categorize	Define system impact levels (Low, Moderate, High)
Select	Choose security controls from NIST SP 800-53
Implement	Deploy and document controls
Assess	Evaluate control effectiveness
Authorize	Decide whether to operate the system
Monitor	Continuously track changes and control performance
