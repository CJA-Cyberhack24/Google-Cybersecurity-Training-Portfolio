# 📌 Module 2: Security Frameworks & Controls


## 🔐 CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is the foundation of information security:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensures sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users.
  - *Example*: Encrypting patient records in a hospital database.
- **Integrity**: Guarantees data is accurate and unaltered.
  - *Example*: Using checksums to verify that a financial transaction hasn’t been tampered with.
- **Availability**: Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed.
  - *Example*: Redundant servers and failover systems for an e-commerce site during peak hours.

## 🧰 Security Frameworks

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

A flexible framework with five core functions:

1. **Identify**: Understand assets, risks, and vulnerabilities.
2. **Protect**: Implement safeguards (e.g., firewalls, access controls).
3. **Detect**: Monitor systems for anomalies.
4. **Respond**: Develop incident response plans.
5. **Recover**: Restore capabilities after an incident.

*Example*: A healthcare provider uses NIST CSF to align its HIPAA compliance strategy.

### OWASP Principles

Focuses on secure software development:

- **Top 10 Risks**: Includes Injection, Broken Authentication, XSS, etc.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Input validation, least privilege, secure session management.

*Example*: A developer uses OWASP guidelines to prevent SQL injection in a login form.

## 🕵️ Security Audit & Risk Review

### Security Audit

A systematic evaluation of systems and controls.

- *Example*: Reviewing firewall rules and access logs to ensure only authorized traffic is allowed.

### Risk Review

Identifies potential threats and evaluates their impact.

- *Example*: Assessing the risk of ransomware on a hospital’s network and implementing backup strategies.
