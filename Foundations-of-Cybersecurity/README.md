## 🔐 Module 1: Glossary Terms & Definitions

| Term              | Definition |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Cybersecurity** | The practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. It's about keeping digital spaces safe and resilient. |
| **CIA Triad**     | The three foundational principles of cybersecurity: **Confidentiality** (limiting access), **Integrity** (ensuring data is unchanged), and **Availability** (keeping systems accessible to authorized users). |
| **Asset**         | Anything of value to an organization—including data, devices, software, and people—that must be protected. |
| **Threat**        | A potential cause of harm to an asset. Threats can be intentional (hackers) or accidental (power outages). |
| **Vulnerability** | A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat to cause harm. Think outdated software or weak passwords. |
| **Risk**          | The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, resulting in harm to an asset. |
| **Threat Actor**  | An individual or group that carries out or intends to carry out a cyberattack—could be a hacker, insider, or even a nation-state. |
| **Firewall**      | A security system that controls traffic between networks—like a digital gatekeeper that blocks or allows data based on rules. |
| **Encryption**    | The process of converting readable data into a coded form, so only those with the correct key can access it. |
| **Authentication**| Verifying the identity of a user, device, or application—often through passwords, biometrics, or tokens. |
| **Authorization** | Determining what an authenticated user or device is allowed to do—like accessing specific files or systems. |
| **Incident Response** | A structured approach to detecting and resolving cyber incidents—includes identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering. |
| **Security Framework** | A set of guidelines or best practices (like NIST or ISO 27001) used to build and maintain secure systems. |
| **Ethical Hacking** | Authorized testing of systems to find vulnerabilities before malicious actors do—a vital part of proactive cybersecurity. |

# 🧩 Module 2: Foundations of Cybersecurity

## 🕰️ A Brief History of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity as a discipline has evolved dramatically since the early days of computing. Here's a snapshot:

- **1960s–70s**: Security focused mainly on physical access and early user authentication for military and governmental systems.
- **1980s**: The rise of personal computers introduced broader risks. The first computer worms and viruses emerged, prompting need for antivirus tools.
- **1990s**: As networks grew, so did the scope of vulnerabilities. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and risk management became essential.
- **2000s to Today**: Cybersecurity matured into a global field, driven by data breaches, ransomware attacks, and the increasing complexity of IT infrastructure. The human factor—social engineering, insider threats—gained prominence.

The ever-changing landscape continues to push cybersecurity from a reactive field to a proactive and strategic pillar in every organization.

## 📚 The 8 Domains of CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)

These domains represent the foundational knowledge areas for professional cybersecurity management, used globally as a framework to build secure systems and processes:

| # | Domain | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Security and Risk Management** | Focuses on governance, compliance, security policies, and ethics. Sets the strategic tone for cybersecurity in an organization. |
| 2 | **Asset Security** | Involves protecting data and physical assets through classification, ownership models, retention policies, and access controls. |
| 3 | **Security Architecture and Engineering** | Covers secure design principles for hardware, software, and networks, including cryptography and system vulnerabilities. |
| 4 | **Communication and Network Security** | Deals with secure network architecture, transmission protocols, firewalls, and remote access technologies. |
| 5 | **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** | Ensures users and systems are appropriately authenticated, authorized, and audited. |
| 6 | **Security Assessment and Testing** | Involves conducting audits, penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and security control evaluations. |
| 7 | **Security Operations** | Covers monitoring, incident response, disaster recovery, and forensics—critical for day-to-day defense. |
| 8 | **Software Development Security** | Integrates security practices into the development lifecycle to prevent vulnerabilities in applications and codebases. |

> 🛡️ _These domains guide cybersecurity professionals across industries—from architecture to operations—with strategies for securing systems at every level._
