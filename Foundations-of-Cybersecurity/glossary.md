## üîê Module 1: Glossary Terms & Definitions

| Term              | Definition |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Cybersecurity** | The practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. It's about keeping digital spaces safe and resilient. |
| **CIA Triad**     | The three foundational principles of cybersecurity: **Confidentiality** (limiting access), **Integrity** (ensuring data is unchanged), and **Availability** (keeping systems accessible to authorized users). |
| **Asset**         | Anything of value to an organization‚Äîincluding data, devices, software, and people‚Äîthat must be protected. |
| **Threat**        | A potential cause of harm to an asset. Threats can be intentional (hackers) or accidental (power outages). |
| **Vulnerability** | A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat to cause harm. Think outdated software or weak passwords. |
| **Risk**          | The likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, resulting in harm to an asset. |
| **Threat Actor**  | An individual or group that carries out or intends to carry out a cyberattack‚Äîcould be a hacker, insider, or even a nation-state. |
| **Firewall**      | A security system that controls traffic between networks‚Äîlike a digital gatekeeper that blocks or allows data based on rules. |
| **Encryption**    | The process of converting readable data into a coded form, so only those with the correct key can access it. |
| **Authentication**| Verifying the identity of a user, device, or application‚Äîoften through passwords, biometrics, or tokens. |
| **Authorization** | Determining what an authenticated user or device is allowed to do‚Äîlike accessing specific files or systems. |
| **Incident Response** | A structured approach to detecting and resolving cyber incidents‚Äîincludes identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering. |
| **Security Framework** | A set of guidelines or best practices (like NIST or ISO 27001) used to build and maintain secure systems. |
| **Ethical Hacking** | Authorized testing of systems to find vulnerabilities before malicious actors do‚Äîa vital part of proactive cybersecurity. |
