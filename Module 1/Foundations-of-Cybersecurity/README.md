# 🧭 Foundations of Cybersecurity

## 📌 Overview
This course kicked off my Google Cybersecurity Certificate journey by laying down the foundational knowledge every cybersecurity professional should know. It introduced key roles, core principles, and industry frameworks that help keep our digital world secure—and emphasized the importance of understanding cybersecurity terminology to communicate and collaborate effectively.

## 🛡️ What Is Cybersecurity?

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and other cyber threats. It involves implementing technologies, processes, and policies designed to guard against exploitation while ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

Cybersecurity professionals play critical roles in identifying risks, securing infrastructure, and responding to incidents to prevent damage to organizations and individuals.

## 🧠 Glossary Spotlight

Here are some key terms introduced in this course that form the bedrock of the cybersecurity field:

| Term                    | Definition |
|------------------------|------------|
| **CIA Triad**          | A model representing the three pillars of cybersecurity: **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**. |
| **Threat Actor**       | Any entity (person, group, or system) that intentionally causes harm to digital assets or infrastructure. |
| **Vulnerability**      | A weakness in a system or process that can be exploited by a threat actor. |
| **Risk**               | The potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. |
| **Authentication**     | The process of verifying the identity of a user or device. |
| **Authorization**      | The process of determining what a user or system has permission to access or perform. |
| **Firewall**           | A network security tool that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules. |
| **Encryption**         | The process of converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access. |
| **Incident Response**  | A structured approach to detecting, managing, and resolving security breaches or attacks. |
| **Security Framework** | A set of guidelines and best practices (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001) used to build and manage secure systems. |
