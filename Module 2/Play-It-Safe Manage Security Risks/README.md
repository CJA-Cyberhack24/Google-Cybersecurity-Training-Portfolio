## 🕰️ A Brief History of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity as a discipline has evolved dramatically since the early days of computing. Here's a snapshot:

- **1960s–70s**: Security focused mainly on physical access and early user authentication for military and governmental systems.
- **1980s**: The rise of personal computers introduced broader risks. The first computer worms and viruses emerged, prompting need for antivirus tools.
- **1990s**: As networks grew, so did the scope of vulnerabilities. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and risk management became essential.
- **2000s to Today**: Cybersecurity matured into a global field, driven by data breaches, ransomware attacks, and the increasing complexity of IT infrastructure. The human factor—social engineering, insider threats—gained prominence.

The ever-changing landscape continues to push cybersecurity from a reactive field to a proactive and strategic pillar in every organization.

## 📚 The 8 Domains of CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)

These domains represent the foundational knowledge areas for professional cybersecurity management, used globally as a framework to build secure systems and processes:

| # | Domain | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Security and Risk Management** | Focuses on governance, compliance, security policies, and ethics. Sets the strategic tone for cybersecurity in an organization. |
| 2 | **Asset Security** | Involves protecting data and physical assets through classification, ownership models, retention policies, and access controls. |
| 3 | **Security Architecture and Engineering** | Covers secure design principles for hardware, software, and networks, including cryptography and system vulnerabilities. |
| 4 | **Communication and Network Security** | Deals with secure network architecture, transmission protocols, firewalls, and remote access technologies. |
| 5 | **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** | Ensures users and systems are appropriately authenticated, authorized, and audited. |
| 6 | **Security Assessment and Testing** | Involves conducting audits, penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and security control evaluations. |
| 7 | **Security Operations** | Covers monitoring, incident response, disaster recovery, and forensics—critical for day-to-day defense. |
| 8 | **Software Development Security** | Integrates security practices into the development lifecycle to prevent vulnerabilities in applications and codebases. |

> 🛡️ _These domains guide cybersecurity professionals across industries—from architecture to operations—with strategies for securing systems at every level._
